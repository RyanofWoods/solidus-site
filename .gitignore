# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global
#
# Here are some files you may want to ignore globally:

# various artifacts
.sass-cache
.DS_Store

# compiled files
.tmp

# PhpStorm project files
.idea

# Yarn local modules
node_modules/
build/
