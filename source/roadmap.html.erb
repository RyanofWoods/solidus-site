                  <p>We are rewriting the Solidus Guide focusing on questions that developers have when approaching common topics in our ecosystem. You'll have the answers you are looking for with a lot of best practices explained that did come with years of experience. </p>

                  <p>Solidus has to be easy to upgrade from one version to another. At the same time we have big changes coming that may make this process harder than usual. That's why we are building a set of tools and processes that will help you staying always up to date with the platform and benefit from the last features.</p>

                  <p>Solidus already shines for its ease of customization, but we want to take it up one notch. We’re one of the first eCommerce solutions to experiment with an event-driven architecture, easier to hook into and inspect. The events system will be accessible both by application code and extensions.</p>

                  <p>In addition to implementing more events and improving our event-driven architecture, we also want to make sure it's easier than ever to replace Solidus' business logic with your own. Be on the lookout for a better, more intentional, more powerful service object architecture.</p>

                  <p>Modifying admin sections to match the business needs of our stores should be easy.
