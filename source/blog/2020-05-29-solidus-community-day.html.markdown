####Introducing Solidus Community Day!

In an effort to bring the amazing Solidus community together more often, we’re setting up a 100% free Solidus Community Day on June 12th, where you’ll be able to talk about the current state of Solidus, the future of Solidus, or just meet & network with eCommerce industry experts. We’ll also have speaker sessions where you’ll be able to hear from Solidus experts about any number of topics.

This month, we’ve got Solidus expert *Peter Berkenbosch*. Peter is an open source eCommerce veteran working with Spree and Solidus frameworks for over a decade, specialized in bridging customers, leadership and development in providing high quality eCommerce stacks. He's a CXOps enthusiast, and passionate in building technology teams and empower them to be the best. 

Peter is going to talk about solidus\_dev\_support and how it supports devs. He'll be generating an extension from scratch and highlighting the features that come out of the box with solidus\_dev\_support.

We’re hoping to make this a monthly event, so we hope you’ll join us in making this Solidus Community Day a success. [You can sign up here](https://live.remo.co/e/solidus-community-day-1) - we hope to see you there!
