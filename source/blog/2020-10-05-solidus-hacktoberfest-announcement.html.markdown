#### It's HacktoberFest! ðŸŽ‰

Hey, Solidus! I'm sure you're aware, but Hacktoberfest started a few days ago. To celebrate, we have a few things for you to consider:

First, to get the sweet HacktoberFest shirt this year, you'll need to [sign up here.](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

After that, you'll need to complete 4 pull requests to a public repository, and you're done! [Check out our issues marked Hacktoberfest if you're looking for a place to start.](https://github.com/solidusio/solidus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3AHacktoberfest)

Second, we're offering more swag in addition to the Hacktoberfest shirt - any author of a merged Solidus PR this month will be able to receive a package of Solidus swag. This PR can be made on any part of Solidus - on the main repository, or on any of our extensions as well. To receive this swag voucher, reach out to [@seand](http://slack.solidus.io) on Slack after making your pull request. At this time, we're only able to ship to these locations: Canada, US, Mexico, and Europe.

Hacktoberfest is one of our favorite times of year. If you are looking for a project to help, or want to start your Open Source journey, Solidus is waiting for you ðŸ’–. 

That's all for now - happy hacking!
