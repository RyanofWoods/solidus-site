### Introducing SolidusConf Speaker Alberto Vena
------

Weâ€™re proud to announce that Alberto Vena will be joining us as a presenter for [SolidusConf 2020](http://conf.solidus.io).

Alberto is passionate about open-source and he founded [Nebulab](https://nebulab.it) with the goal of creating a sustainable company for people who share the same passion. But since he started the company he has a curse: everybody spells his name wrong. He's also one of the members of the Solidus Core Team.

#### The State of Solidus

We've had a lot of shocks in the Solidus (and Spree) community in the last few years, and we need stability. Alberto will cover what's happened since the previous maintainers left the project, and how a group of people that care about Solidus are trying to make the platform more solid than ever.
