### Introducing SolidusConf Speaker Rob Johnson
------

Weâ€™re proud to announce that Rob Johnson will be joining us as a presenter for [SolidusConf 2020](http://conf.solidus.io).

Rob has been working with design, content and development teams since 2009. Before that he enjoyed a short stint developing and teaching a new Digital Strategies curriculum for a University as an Adjunct Professor, until he realized that providing for his family is important. He's also worked in News Media for some of the largest news entities in Utah, until he realized that a good business model is important. Originally from the Northwest of England, Rob dreams of spending days in British Columbia, Canada, playing his classical guitar on the deck, gazing at the stars reflecting from the lake after grilling up a scrumdiddlyumptious dinner.

#### Solidus & Subscriptions: Adventures of a Publisher Trying to Disrupt Itself

Subscriptions have become increasingly popular due to the financial stability they produce for businesses and investors. Done right, subscriptions deliver great value for customers with draws such as unlimited access, original product and deep discounting that can often lead to increased brand affinity and lifetime value. We'll review a 2.5 year timeline of the impact subscriptions have had for a Publisher and Retailer using Solidus. We'll cover learnings around acquisition and retention, subscription usage trends, customer survey insights, upgrade experiences and the importance of empowering the customer.
