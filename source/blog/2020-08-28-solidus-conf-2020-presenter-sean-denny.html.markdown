### Introducing SolidusConf Presenter Sean Denny
------

Weâ€™re proud to announce that Sean Denny will be joining us as a presenter for [SolidusConf 2020](http://conf.solidus.io).

Sean Denny is a developer at Nebulab and member of the Solidus Stakeholders - he's also the organizer for this and previous SolidusConfs! He got his start in web development at the age of 11, learning HTML to build a [Zelda fansite](https://web.archive.org/web/20010405002630/http://zeldacraziness.tripod.com/). His design skills have improved slightly since then. After work, Sean spends his time playing guitar, video games, and listening to the worst music imaginable.

#### Don't Panic: The Solidus Guide to ReactJS

How do you bring the speed of ReactJS to the flexible and scalable Solidus ecosystem? The first step: Don't panic. Sean will take you through the basics - taking a vanilla Solidus store and adding ReactJS in step by step. Follow along as we take a look at how the Solidus API interacts with React, how React routing works, and some of the benefits of using ReactJS with Solidus. Just don't forget to bring your towel.

The workshop is a new addition to the SolidusConf lineup. These sessions will be longer than our traditional speaker spots, and more technically focused - be prepared to follow along as Sean shows you how to speed up your frontend!
